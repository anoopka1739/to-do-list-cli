# to-do-list-cli
A Python Based Application that can be controlled via python cli to prepare a To-do list

This is the document for the to-do-list app I will be building to learn python.

For any application, before building, we need to basically answer 3 sections:
1. What is the input: For our to-do-list app, its to get to-do-list from user as input.
2. What is the process - Process can be either store that in a text file or in a DB for later analysis.
3. What is the output? Output will be we want to display list of to-do to user.
